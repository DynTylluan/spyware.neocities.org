  <h1>Online Spyware Classification Project — Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  <p><a href="../index.html">Back to Home</a></p>
  <h2>What is spyware?</h2>
  <p>
Spyware is a classification of programs which collect information about their users. Any program which collects any kind of information about its users is  spyware. Programs are held in contempt (guilty until proven innocent) when evaluating spyware features. Spyware features include but are not limited to     unavailable source code, telemetry of any kind, persistent user identities, network connectivity, and information collection on users, such as asking for a telephone number.

  <h2>How does this website classify spyware?</h2>
  <p>
At a glance, this website will give spyware programs a spyware rating and then a summary of why it has that rating, followed by a detailed rationale for giving the program that rating. The ratings that are present on the website right now are:
 </p>
  <table border background="../images/bg.jpg" style="width:800px">
  <tr>
  <th>Spyware Rating</th>
  <th>Category Rationale</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td><center><h3><font color=red>EXTREMELY HIGH</font></h3></center></td>
  <td>Reserved for the most invasive spyware programs, that collect the most amount of data, and the most sensitive data, with no opt-out's. These programs should be avoided entirely. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td><center>  <h3><font color="orange">High</font></h3></center></td>
  <td>For spyware that collects high amounts of data, but doesn't collect as much data, or data that is as important as the worst spyware out there. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td><center><h3><font color=yellow>Medium</font></h3></center></td>
  <td>For spyware that collects some data, but is transparent and doesn't collect a lot of data, or any important data. You should be able to disable all spyware features for a program to get this rating.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
  <td><center><h3><font color=yellowgreen>Low</font></h3></center></td>
  <td>For software that has some form of data collection that is extremely limited.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
  <td><center><h3><font color=greenyellow>Potential Spyware</font></h3></center></td>
  <td>For software that can't be proven to be not spyware, and have red flags that make them suspicious without definite proof of spying.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td><center><h3><font color="lightgreen">Probably not Spyware</font></h3></center></td>
  <td>For software that doesn't seem to be spyware, but can't be absolutely proven to not be spyware.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td><center><h3><font color=lime>Not Spyware</font></h3></center></td>
  <td>For software that completely respects the privacy of its users.</td>
  </tr>

  <td><center><h3><font color=lime>N</font><font color=lightgreen>o</font><font color=yellowgreen>t</font> <font color=yellow>R</font><font color=orange>a</font><font color=red>t</font><font color=orange>e</font><font color=yellow>d</font></h3></center></td>
  <td>For software that has an article, but does not have a complete article. The color of the text indicates what spyware score the incomplete article is leaning towards.</td>

Any language should be fine. Currently there are only English and Spanish articles on the site, but it doesn't matter what language you want to submit articles in.
  </p>
  <h2>I want to amend/change the style guide and/or the spyware classification guide.</h2>
  <p>
Submitting a pull request at the <a href="https://codeberg.org/shadow/SpywareWatchdog">Codeberg</a>, or contacting us via the XMPP at spyware@conference.nuegia.net with a new version of the guide in question, detailing the changes you have made and the reasons for these changes.

  <h2>Spyware and Software Licensing</h2>
  <p>
To be able to know if a program has absolutely no spyware features, you have to be able to compile it from source- it does not need to meet any of the other requirements that it would need to meet to be called "Free Software" or "Open Source Software" according to the definitions of the FSF or OSI. So, I don't like to use the words "Free Software" or "Open Source Software" on my website because it implies that a program needs to meet all of the requirements set by those organizations to be called "Free" or "Open" for spyware concerns to be alleviated. If you can compile it from source, that is the only thing needed.
  </p>
  <p>
Although, I don't want to say that just because a program allows you to compile it from source, it isn't spyware. It just ensures that you can be aware of all spyware features, and that there is no spyware hidden inside of a binary blob. Also, programs that do not distribute their sources can be analyzed even though they are only distributed as binaries, which is in fact how we know about some of the more underhanded spyware features that Steam and Discord have, for example.
