        <h1>CDex</h1>
        <p>
          CDex is an Open Source Digital Audio CD Extractor.
        </p>
        <h2>Spyware Level: <span class="yellowgreen">Low</span></h2>
        <p>
          CDex's installer bundles it with spyware, and it will randomly suggest
          a spyware program to the user, with a chance to opt-out. Usually it
          attempts to bundle itself with the webdiscover browser and one time I
          got it to try and offer me an antivirus program, but I wasn't able to
          reproduce this. The program was tested on Windows 7 32-bit with
          Microsoft Network Monitor 3.4 and Wireshark 2.6.2. The version of the
          program tested was 2.06.

            ></b
          >
          that my tests were able to find. To test the program I ripped the
          audio files out of a CD with both network monitoring programs open.
        </p>
        <h3>Bundling with spyware</h3>
        <p>
          CDex attempts to bundle it self with the
          <a href="../articles/webdiscover.html">WebDiscover</a> web browser.
          This is an Opt-out and not an Opt-in like it should be. This program
          is spyware, because according to it's privacy policy<sup
            ><a href="#s1">[1]</a></sup
          >, it collects information about it's users.
        </p>
