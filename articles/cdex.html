  CDex is an Open Source Digital Audio CD Extractor.
  </p>
  <h2>Spyware Level: <font color=yellowgreen>Low</font></h2>
  <p>
  CDex's installer bundles it with spyware, and it will randomly suggest a spyware program to the user, with a chance to opt-out.
  Usually it attempts to bundle itself with the webdiscover browser and one time I got it to try and offer me an antivirus program, but
  I wasn't able to reproduce this. The program was tested on Windows 7 32-bit with Microsoft Network Monitor 3.4 and Wireshark 2.6.2. 
  The version of the program tested was 2.06. <b><font color="lime">It did not make any connections to the internet</font></b> that my 
  tests were able to find. To test the program I ripped the audio files out of a CD with both network monitoring programs open.

  <h3>Bundling with spyware</h3>
  <p>
  CDex attempts to bundle it self with the <a href="/articles/webdiscover.html">WebDiscover</a> web browser. This is an Opt-out and not an Opt-in like it should be. 
  This program is spyware, because according to it's privacy policy<sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>, it collects information about it's users.
