This is a catalog of all of the Spanish articles on this site. Some of these articles are translations of other English articles on the site and some
are only in Spanish. Thanks to one very helpful contributor, these articles have been translated. If you know English and Spanish, and want to make
this catalog larger, consider translating an article, or writing your own articles, in Spanish. It would be very much appreciated.

If you want to edit any of these articles, or contribute your own articles, contact us on XMPP over in spyware@conference.nuegia.net, or visit us at the git repo on <a href="https://codeberg.org/TheShadow/SpywareWatchdog">Codeberg</a>.
