  <h1>Tor Browser</h1>
  <p>
Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against traffic analysis, a form of network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships, and state security.<sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <h2>Spyware Level: <font color="lime">Not Spyware</font></h2>
  <p>
The Tor browser is a privacy focused web browser that is used to access the internet either normally or through the Tor Network.
Connections through the Tor network are much more private than normal connections as you do not have an IP address that is
associated with you. While spyware services can tell that you are connecting from the Tor network, their ability to identify and profile you is
greatly reduced. Tor browser is <b><font color="lime">Not Spyware</font></b> and is the best web browser to use for privacy.
  </p>
  <p>
One thing that complicates this review is that most browsers are chastised for sending auto-update requests. However, the Tor browser is doing
this over the Tor network... so while it's definitely "phoning home", it's doing so in an anonymous way.
