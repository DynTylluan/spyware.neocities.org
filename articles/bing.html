				<h1>Bing</h1>
				<p>
					This part of the article should have the name of the program and what
					it does, and who develops it.
				</p>
				<h2>Spyware Level: <span class="red">EXTREMELY HIGH</span></h2>
				<p>
					Bing is yet another spyware search engine that collects your
					information and sells it to advertisers. It's strongly recommended
					that you do not use Bing.
				</p>
				<p>
					At some point Bing had a privacy policy, but Microsoft doesn't seem to
					be hosting it anymore. So, this article will look at the Microsoft
					Privacy Statement<sup><a href="#s1">[1]</a></sup> to help us
					understand what information Bing collects. Similarly to the privacy
					policies of Google and Apple, the Microsoft privacy statement eclipses
					the entire spyware platform and does not help you understand in great
					detail what kind of information one single program could be
					collecting. (although this policy is more specific)
				</p>

				<h3>Bing collects your search history</h3>

				<p>
					From the Microsoft Privacy Statement<sup><a href="#s1">[1]</a></sup
					>:
				</p>

				<p>
					<i>
						"Microsoft collects data from you, through our interactions with you
						and through our products for a variety of purposes described
						below. [...] You provide some of this data directly, such as when
						you [...] submit a search query to Bing"
					</i>
				</p>

				<p>
					Later in the Interactions -> Device and usage data section of this
					statement, it is clarified again that Microsoft collects your:
					<i>"Browse History. Data about the web pages you visit."</i>, as well
					as your:
					<i
						>"Images. Images and related information, such as picture metadata.
						For example, we collect the image you provide when you use a Bing
						image-enabled service."</i
					>
				</p>

				<p>
					Microsoft claims to store this information for an unlimited amount of
					time, but it claims that it will eventually anonymize this information
					in a process that takes 18 months to complete.
				</p>
				<p></p>

				<p>
					<i>
						"Has Microsoft adopted and announced a specific retention period for
						a certain data type? For example, for Bing search queries, we
						de-identify stored queries by removing the entirety of the IP
						address after 6 months, and cookie IDs and other cross-session
						identifiers after 18 months. "
					</i>
				</p>

				<h3>Bing uses your search history to profile you for advertising</h3>

				<p>
					From the Microsoft Privacy Statement<sup><a href="#s1">[1]</a></sup
					>:
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>
						"Microsoft may use data we collect to select and deliver some of the
						ads you see on Microsoft web properties, such as Microsoft.com, MSN
						and Bing."
					</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					So since your search history is part of the "data we collect", the
					natural conclusion is that, your search queries are being used to
					profile you for advertising. And of course, this is confirmed in this
					section:
				</p>

				<p>
					<i>
						"The ads that you see may be selected based on data we process about
						you, such as your interests and favorites, your location, your
						transactions, how you use our products,
						<b>
							<font color="red"> your search queries </font>
						</b>
						, or the content you view. For example, if you view content on MSN
						about automobiles, we may show advertisements about cars; if you
						search “pizza places in Seattle” on Bing, you may see advertisements
						in your search results for restaurants in Seattle."
					</i>
				</p>

				<h3>Bing sells your search history to other spyware platforms</h3>

				<p>
					From the Microsoft Privacy Statement<sup><a href="#s1">[1]</a></sup
					>:
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>
						"We may share data we collect with third parties, such as Oath,
						AppNexus, or Facebook (see below), so that the ads you see in our
						products, their products, or other sites and apps serviced by these
						partners are more relevant and valuable to you. "
					</i>
