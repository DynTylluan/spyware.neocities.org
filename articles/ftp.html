FTP is a protocol used for transferring files over a computer network.

  <h2>Spyware Level: <font color=lime>Not Spyware</font></h2>
  <p>
FTP does not collect any information than the absolute minimum needed to provide its service. As such you could say that FTP's information is only incidental to the service it provides. So, FTP is not a spyware protocol. You are only giving up your IP address, which of course is required can be hidden through proxies. FTP requires you to uniquely identify yourself as a user of a system to use its access control features, but beyond that it does not ask you for unncessary information about your computer, unlike the <a href="../articles/http.html">HTTP</a> protocol.
