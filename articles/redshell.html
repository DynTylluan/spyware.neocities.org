  <h1>Redshell</h1>
  <p>
Redshell is a spyware platform that is integrated into many video games.
  </p>
  <h2>Spyware Level: <font color=red>EXTREMELY HIGH</font></h2>
  <p>
Redshell is a spyware platform. Its purpose is to collect huge amounts of information about its user's computers
to try and connect marketing data (collected through other spyware platforms) to actual results. It fingerprints
any computers it is attached too and phones home. It also collects information about how a player has been interacting
with the video game that it is embedded in. It's strongly recommended that any programs that embed this spyware are
avoided entirely.
  </p>
  <h3>Redshell collects a huge amount of information from its users machines</h3>
  <p>
  Redshell has confirmed that it collects the following information<sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Operating System</li>
  <li>Installed Browsers</li>
  <li>Available Fonts</li>
  <li>Screen Resolution</li>
  <li>IP Address</li>
  <li>Timezone</li>
  <li>System Language</li>
  <li>Game-Specific UUID</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  This is obviously a very large amount of information being mined. The purpose of this is to fingerprint the user as well
  as possible, destroying any kind of anonymity. It goes beyond most spyware programs in the information it collects, by
  scanning your computer for installed programs and collecting various demographic information about the user. It's very clear
  that this is a huge amount of personal information to be collecting, despite all of the claims on the official website about how
  innocent this data is.
  <p>
  <h3>Phoning home</h3>
  <p>
  Redshell is designed to phone home at its client's (the game developer) whim. Any program using Redshell will phone home with
  personal information in a way peculiar to that program.
  </p>
  <h3>Sharing Information with third parties</h3>
  <p>
 Redshell clearly says that it shares any kind of marketing data with third parties<sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>:
  </p>
  <p><i>
  "For example: Studio X wants to run ads through Google AdWords. When a potential customer clicks on an that ad, they are sent through our tracking link and redirected to the destination set by the studio (in the same way a bitly link works) — usually their game's Steam page. AdWords provides us with unique id for that user and if they end up playing the game, we tell AdWords so they know the ad was effective."
  </i></p>
  <p>
  Of course, the words "integrated partner" are used to describe these third parties. The bottom line is that other people are being
  given this information. There is also an important distinction to make when talking about this: as Redshell's spyware is a product,
  Redshell does not actually have control over what the buyers of that product can do. So, just because Redshell doesn't sell the
  information its spyware collects about it's users to third parties, that doesn't mean that the buyers of the product do not or
  will not sell the information that they collect through Redshell to third parties.
