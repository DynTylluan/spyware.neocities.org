GNU IceCat is a web browser that is a fork of <a href="../articles/firefox.html">Firefox</a>.
  </p>
  <h2>Spyware Level: <font color=lime>Not Spyware</font></h2>
  <p>
GNU IceCat is a fork of Firefox that is more private and secure than Firefox and it contains several privacy-protecting features. IceCat 60 makes <font color=lime><b>no unsolicited connections</b></font> when you run it. Previous versions had privacy problems, but version 60 doesn't have these problems. You can read about the previous version here: <a href="../articles/icecat59.html">IceCat 59 Review</a>

  <h3>IceCat's privacy features</h3>
  <p>
  From <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gnuzilla/">gnu.org</a>:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>LibreJS: GNU LibreJS aims to address the JavaScript problem described in Richard Stallman's article The JavaScript Trap.</li>
  <li>Https-Everywhere: Extension that encrypts your communications with many major websites, making your browsing more secure.</li>
  <li>AboutIceCat: Adds a custom "about:icecat" homepage with links to information about the free software and privacy features in IceCat, and checkboxes to enable and disable the ones more prone to break websites.</li>
  <li>Fingerprinting countermeasures: Fingerprinting is a series of techniques allowing to uniquely identify a browser based on specific characterisics of that particular instance (like what fonts are available in that machine). Unlike cookies the user cannot opt-out of being tracked this way, so the browser has to avoid giving away that kind of hints.</li>
  </ul>
