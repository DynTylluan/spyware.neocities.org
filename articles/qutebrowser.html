  From their website: "qutebrowser is a keyboard-focused browser with a minimal GUI. It's based on Python and PyQt5 and free software, licensed under the GPL." Program tested: v1.3.0 for Windows 7 64-bit. Mitmproxy was used to check for connections.

  <h2>Spyware Level: <font color=lime>Not Spyware</font></h2>
  <p>
Qutebrowser <b><font color=lime>makes no unsolicited requests at all.</font></b> It is also fully open source. This web browser is a great choice to use, and there is
nothing to complain about from a privacy standpoint. (although I don't really know how to use the User Interface that well... ) So far this browser looks like it can stand tall in the ranks of the other privacy-respecting web browsers out there.
