        <p>
          Brave Browser is a Chromium fork with many interesting features not
          found elsewhere, such as built-in Adblock and other extensions,
          fingerprinting protection, cleaner Preferences menu than other Chrome
          forks, and the (opt-in) ability to automatically support (pay) the
          websites you visit. The developers describe it as
          <i>"A browser with your interests at heart."</i
          ><sup><a href="#s1">[1]</a></sup> With the built-in privacy
          protections, some would seem to agree with that. Let's see how it
          stacks up when we take everything into account.
        </p>

          <a href="../articles/google.html">Google</a> as default search engine.

          of Brave. Whitelisting spyware from Facebook and Twitter.<sup
            ><a href="#s5">[5]</a></sup
          >
          Has some decent privacy protections built in, but uMatrix is still
          better. Some privacy features are there by default, but, it's still
          trying to work with advertisers (same as Mozilla did with their
          Sponsored Tiles). Despite claiming to be
          <i>"A browser with your interests at heart."</i
          ><sup><a href="#s1">[1]</a></sup
          >, it has <a href="../articles/google.html">Google</a> as default
          search engine, as well as shitty forced updates. Anyway, despite the
          privacy protections, you should stay away from this browser — it seems
          to have a "mission" to switch the internet to its version of
          "user-respecting" ads, (we know how that turned out for Mozilla), and
          that's slimy and suspicious. Beyond that it has repeatedly shown
          itself to be dishonest and disingenuous about what it's mission and
          goals and operations are.
        </p>
        <h3>Whitelisting spyware from Facebook and Twitter</h3>
        <p>
          On its website, Brave claims that
          <i
            >"Brave fights malware and prevents tracking, keeping your
            information safe and secure. It’s our top priority."</i
          ><sup><a href="#s6">[6]</a></sup
          >. Yet despite this claim, Brave actually
          <b><font color="red">disables</font></b> its tracking protections for
          Facebook and Twitter's spyware scripts that allow them to track people
          across the web.<sup><a href="#s5">[5]</a></sup> Brave's spyware
          protections, and any claims that it makes to work in the interests of
          its users,
          <b><font color="orange">cannot be taken seriously.</font></b> Brave is
          actively working
          <b><font color="red">against its users</font></b> while lying to them
          about supposed privacy protections that it offers. This problem
          becomes even more serious when you take into account Brave's response
          to this situation:
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>
            "Loading a script from an edge-cache does not track a user without
            third-party cookies or equivalent browser-local storage, which Brave
            always blocks and always will block. In other words, sending
            requests and receiving responses without cookies or other means of
            identifying users does not necessarily create a tracking threat."
          </i>
          <sup>
            <a href="#s7">[7]</a>
          </sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          This statement is just <b><font color="red">completely wrong</font></b>.
          Just because a website isn't able to store cookies, does not mean
          that it cannot uniquely identify you. Executing JavaScript spyware
          from Facebook and Twitter is
          <b>
            more than enough.
          </b>
          Blocking cookies is not going to stop them from tracking you. This
          isn't even information that is difficult to verify. There are many
          websites that you can visit right now, to see just how much
          information a JavaScript program designed to track you can get.
        </p>
        <center>
          <p>
            Here are a few:
            <br />
            <a href="https://browserleaks.com/">https://browserleaks.com/</a>
            <br />
            <a href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/"
              >https://panopticlick.eff.org/</a
            >
            <br />
          </p>
        </center>
        <h3>Auto-updates</h3>
        <p>
          Brave will check for updates every time you run it, and you CANNOT
          turn it off (except through fiddling with DNS and such) ! What is the
          devs' answer? From their GitHub page
          <sup><a href="#s2">[2]</a></sup
          >:
        </p>

        <p>
          <i>
            "We don't plan on adding in UI to disable updates, but users can
            easily adjust environment variables if they really want to put
            themselves at risk."
          </i>
        </p>

        <p>and</p>

        <p>
          <i>
            "i feel that being able to figure out how to do this is a
            sufficiently high bar for users who want to turn off autoupdating
            (to prove they know what they're doing and understand the security
            implications)"
          </i>
        </p>

        <p>
          So according to the devs, you have to hunt down random internet
          comments to be able to disable auto-updating. Brave will also update
          what looks like the list of its "partners" every time you run it.
          Extensions are also updated often.
          <img class="screenshot" src="../images/brave_partners.png" />
        </p>

        <h3>Anti-privacy search engine by default</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="../articles/google.html">Google</a>
          is the default search engine of Brave, and the issues with it are well
          known and would take a book to describe them all.
        </p>

        <h3>Brave's start page contains analytics</h3>
        <p>
          Brave will connect to its home page, https://brave.com, automatically
          on the first run of Brave, and that page contains Piwik's analytics
          scripts. This is the full request:
          <img class="screenshot" src="../images/brave_piwik.png" />
          It will also make a connection to Google to download some fonts. You
          can disable these on subsequent runs by changing the start page.
        </p>
        <h3>Crash reports</h3>
        <p>
          Enabled by default, but can be disabled from the preferences menu.
        </p>
        <h3>Other requests</h3>
        <p>
          Brave will make a connection to this site every time it is started up:
          <img class="screenshot" src="../images/brave_bat.png" />
          It probably has something to do with their project of working with
          advertisers to provide more relevant targeted ads, which sounds pretty
          disgusting, but can be turned off ("Notify me about token
          promotions"). You can read more about it here
          <sup><a href="#s3">[3]</a></sup>
          .It will also make this request which downloads the rulesets for HTTPS
          Everywhere:
          <img class="screenshot" src="../images/brave_httpse.png" />
        </p>
        <h3>Brave's privacy protections</h3>
        <p>
          Brave Browser also contains in-built privacy protections such as HTTPS
          Everywhere, AdBlock, cookie blocking, script blocking, and
          fingerprinting protections — that are configurable site by site. This
          is commendable of course, but in the end, uMatrix outclasses them.
          Trackers, for example, easily avoid pure AdBlock (so you will be
          tracked by Facebook and such), and binary script blocking breaks
          sites. Nice effort on Brave's part though, and the fingerprinting
          protection I don't think is found in any other browser (but I didn't
          confirm if it actually works).
